Simple extension to manage project resources

## Development

1. Install the dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the
file.

⚠️ **Note:** Some  Next.js features require a Node.js web server, so server-related features, like next/image, are unsupported by a Chrome extension. Check more details [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#unsupported-features).

## Build and install extension

To create a production build of the extension:
```
pnpm build
```

Head to `chrome:///extensions` in a new Chrome browser window, enable **Developer Mode,** and click the **Load Unpacked** button. Choose `extension` folder generated by the code build.
